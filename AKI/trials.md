- randomly assigned critically ill patients with AKI and failure of at least one nonrenal organ or sepsis

- intensive vs less intensive RRT 

- hemodynamically stable - IHD, hemodynamically unstable - CVVHDF or SLED

- intensive: IHD/SLED 6x/wk, CVVHDF @35 mL/kg/hr 

- less-intensive: IHD/SLED 3x/wk, CVVHDF @20 mL/kg/hr 

- rate of death from any cause by day 60 was 53.6% with intensive therapy and 51.5% with less-intensive therapy (OR, 1.09; 95% CI 0.86-1.40; P=0.47) 

- no significant difference between the two groups in
    - duration of RRT
    - rate of recovery of kidney function
    - nonrenal organ failure
